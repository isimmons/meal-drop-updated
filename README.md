# Meal Drop

This is an extemely updated version of Yahn Bragas Meal Drop application from his course on newline.

I've updated everything (I mean everything) and fixed breaking changes. I still have a ways to go to get it perfect.

After fixing process and global not defined issues, Everything is working now.
run dev
run storybook
run build
run build-storybook

I still need to add testing but visual confirmation that everything is working.

Haven't deployed to vercel or netlify yet so there's that fiasco to look forward to.
